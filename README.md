# Green Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
Utilizing the Green Stock data from 2017 to 2018, we were tasked with a project from the University of Wisconsin. In this scenario for the project, our client Steven asked that we refactor the code that we created in VBA so that it can show the returns of all green stocks on a new Excel sheet for the given years. Steven was concerned about the efficiency of our current code and hoped that our refactored code would be quicker due to the thousands of rows it has to go through. On the new sheet, Steven needed it to display the year of the stocks, ticker symbol, the total daily volume, and the end-of-year return for each stock. 


## Results
Below is the VBA code that needed to be refactored. 
```

## Summary
### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring
The advantages of refactoring code is that it allows a more readable and managable experience for team members. The disadvantage is introducing bugs, errors, or breaking the code.
